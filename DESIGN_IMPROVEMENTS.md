# MRR Dashboard - Complete Design & UX Improvements

## üéØ Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive design improvements and navigation fixes made to the MRR Dashboard frontend to achieve a modern, professional, and fully functional user interface.

## üö® Critical Fixes Applied

### Navigation System Fixed ‚úÖ

- **Impact**: All authenticated pages now have consistent layout with sidebar and navigation

### Debug Sections Removed ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Temporary debug info sections were showing on dashboard
- **Solution**: Removed debug sections and restored functional metrics display
- **Impact**: Clean, professional interface without development artifacts

### Profile Page Enhanced ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Profile page was a standalone route without main layout
- **Solution**: Created new integrated profile component with modern design
- **Impact**: Professional profile management within consistent app layout

## üé® Design System Enhancements

### Color Palette & Variables
- **Enhanced Color System**: Updated primary color from `#4f46e5` to `#6366f1` for better accessibility
